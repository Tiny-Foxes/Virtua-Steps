# What is this?
This is a modification of the legacy theme from StepMania 5.0.x to be used as a theming playground of sorts trying to come up with something I personally feel proud of.

## I want to…
- Completely change the visual aesthetic. Like yes the aesthetic is fine and all but I wanna end up with something that... y'know... *isn't* the legacy theme.
- Allow the user to change the theme’s color scheme.
- Add a new "Beginners" mode with a simplified song select menu, simplified judgments (using a 4 row system with the default judgments ranging from "Right On!" to "Too Late.../Too Early..."), and the new "Beginners" mod menu.
- Add more modifiers, as well as a “beginners” mod menu that new players can use to easily set mods.
  - You'll be able to choose your Mini value with a real-time preview!
    - This real-time preview will also show your current speed mod, noteskin, perspective, and scroll direction!
- Add support for OutFox's Judgments folder as well as a brand new "Numbers" and "HoldJudgments" folder (you'll need to place these folders in your Appearance folder for them to work).
